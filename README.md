**niceML** is a tool to help you set up your machine learning projects faster. 
It provides pipelines for a variety of ML tasks, like

- **Object Detection**,
- **Semantic Segmentation**,
- **Regression**,
- **Classification**
- and others.

All you have to do is configure your pipeline, and you're ready to go!

You can also add your own components to the build-in dashboard, 
where you can compare the results and performance of your ML models.

Further documentation is available at [niceML.io](https://niceml.io).

A lot more documentation will follow soon!
