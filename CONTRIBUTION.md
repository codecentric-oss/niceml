branching model. Ensure your branch names align with the conventions outlined there.

## Documentation

Improvements to documentation are always appreciated. Please submit documentation
changes along with your code changes.
We are using [mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to create
the [niceML
documentation](https://niceml.io/). Please use Markdown to create new documentation
pages and add it inside the `docs` folder. Make sure to add the file in the `SUMMARY.md`
file, so it can will be displayed on the website.
